# Covid-19-cases-predicition-with-LSTM-cells

A deep learning project based on Recurrent neural networks in order to predict the number of new Covid-19 cases in Canada.
Since Canada has borders with only one country, The united states of america, I decided to take into consideration 3 variables:
Number of cases in the world, Canada and the United States.
